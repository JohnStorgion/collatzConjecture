# collatzConjecture
A simple calculator demonstrating the Collatz Conjecture (or 3n+1 problem) - just made for fun.
The unproven conjecture proposes that by taking any number n and letting n = n/2 if even or n = 3n+1 if odd, it will always eventually reduce to 1

The calculator allows the user to enter any positive number and see each step of the process, and the number of steps to get to 1. Enter a negative number to exit the program.

This project is intended to be a programming exercise to better familiarize myself with the SOLID design principles, so it may be a little over-engineered :)

Typescript compiler needed to run the program
